# 10-20 Assignments File
In this collection, you will find various tasks and code examples that illustrate the concepts I've learned and applied in Java. The assignments showcase different aspects of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Overview
I started focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java to build a strong foundation in writing modular, maintainable, and reusable code. Each assignment demonstrates my understanding and application of OOP concepts.

## Assignments details
- **In this section you will know all details about every assignment in this file**

1. Calculator.java
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Methods, User Input Handling, Loops.
Task: Create a simple calculator program using classes and methods. Implement a class CalculatorOperations with methods for basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Another class Calculator uses CalculatorOperations to perform these operations based on user input.

2. Car.java 
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Constructor, Method.
Task: Create a class Car with attributes for make, model, and year. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes and a method to display the details of the car.

3. Employee1.java
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Constructor, Method, this keyword.
Task: Create a class Employe with attributes for name and salary. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes, a method to increase the salary, and a method to display the salary.

4. EmployeeManagementSystem.java 
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Constructor, Method.
Task: Create a class Employee with attributes for name and salary. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes, a method to increase the salary, and a method to display the updated salary.

5. Human.java
- Concepts Appliedp: sulation with Validation
Task: Create a class Human with private attributes for name, email, and age. Implement constructor and getter/setter methods for each attribute. Use private methods to validate the values before setting them.

6. Main.java
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Method Overriding, Constructor.
Task: Create classes Person, Student, and Teacher. Implement inheritance where Student and Teacher extend Person. Each class should have a showDetails() method to display relevant information.

7. Main2.java 
- Concepts Applied: Inheritance, Method Overriding, Polymorphism.
Task: Create a base class Animal with a method speak(). Create derived classes Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal and override the speak() method to display different sounds.

8. Main3.java
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Validation, this keyword, Method.
Task: Create a class Circle with private attributes for radius and color. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes, a private method to calculate the area, and a method to display the circle's details.
Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Constructor, Private Method, this keyword.

9. Rectangle.java
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Method Chaining, Method.
Task: Create a class Rectangle with attributes for length and width. Implement methods to set these attributes using method chaining and a method to calculate the area of the rectangle.

10. Student.java 
- Concepts Applied: Encapsulation, Constructor Overloading, Method.
Task: Create a class Student with attributes for name, grade, and student ID. Implement multiple constructors to initialize these attributes in different ways and a method to display student information. 


## Summary
These assignments reflect my progress in mastering Java OOP concepts. I have focused on building reusable and modular code, leveraging various OOP principles to solve problems effectively.
